48461,Old Diamond Match Mill,"The project funds are being used to clean up friable asbestos as well as to remove numerous containers of hazardous chemicals and compounds that are present in the site's buildings. There was a high potential for release of such chemicals to the environment by fire, flood or deterioration of these containers due to age. Release of these chemicals to the environment could have contaminated groundwater with subsequent migration to adjacent surface water bodies or private water supply wells. These substances could have found their way to the air or ground and affect not only the groundwater and private wells but could enter the two close proximity rivers, which would also increase threats to a greater number of citizens downwind and/or downriver. This project is allowing us to properly remove environmental threats associated with the release of hazardous materials and friable asbestos with consequent protection of human health and the environment. Elimination or mitigation of these threats to an acceptable level is the goal of any efforts using this funding. With the reduction of environmental threats, the site became much more attractive for redevelopment. The community response has been positive and the Town of Peru is excited to have the property back in the private sector for redevelopment and potential opportunities to the residents of Peru and the surrounding communities. James Dolloff of Dixfield which neighbors the town of Peru will be the official new owner once closing paperwork on the DEED transfer is complete. James placed a deposit on site at the auction on June 27, 2007. James has several ideas and will be working on different uses for the mill. The US EPA and Maine DEP have played a very important role by providing us with the funds and expertise of removing all environmental threats to allow for redevelopment of an old contaminated building. The new owner and town of Peru are now able to move forward with confidence knowing the property is clean and safe for the community. (PPF - Old Diamond Match Mill, 7/10/07)

Former Use: The site contains several mill buildings constructed prior to 1934 which have been vacant since 1988.

Former Use: The Eastern Fine Paper site was originally developed in the late 1700s as a sawmill operation. The manufacture of paper pulp began on the site in 1889 as a way to dispose of waste wood from its sawmill operations. Seven years later the Eastern Manufacturing Company began paper manufacturing there. For years it produced high quality paper goods including manila and wrapping papers in the 1890’s, boxes in the 1930’s, and alkaline papers in the 1980’s. It provided many of the jobs in South Brewer and, for most of its existence, was the largest property taxpayer in Brewer as well as largest sewer user in Brewer. In September of 2000, Eastern Pulp & Paper, Eastern Fine Paper’s parent company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It never emerged from Chapter 11, and on January 14, 2004, Eastern Fine Paper ceased operation, sent its employees home, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and the Brewer mill was left vacant.",Brewer

The Town was approached by a local developer to wants to develop the space as ""maker"" space where small businesses could set up shop and have a shared space to work in. Specifically, the developer proposed to turn the tannery annex into a metal fabrication shop and maker?s space, directly employing several local residents for his operations and hopefully opening up more economic opportunities for other local fabricators. Mr. Warner has lined up enough work to begin making an economic contribution to Hartland almost immediately, and has a vision of using the bulk of the complex to open up opportunities to other Hartland residents.
