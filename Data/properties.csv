222261,International Woolen Mill - Mill Building,NA,"The Site is located off Heritage Boulevard also referred to as Weaver Drive in the City of Sanford, York County, Maine. The Site referred to as Lot 24 currently contains the former Boiler House building, chimney, UST Vault, and parking area among other features. Lot 24 at the International Woolen Site has operated as a boiler house as part of an industrial complex since at least 1892. Over the years the building’s configuration has changed, as well as the fuel source evolved from coal to #6 fuel oil. The location of the fuel storage has also changed as renovations occurred. Several reported historical releases of petroleum products and other hazardous materials have occurred at the Site. Given that the Site has operated for over 125 years as an industrial facility, additional historical releases likely occurred prior to implementation of current housekeeping practices and environmental regulations. While some of these releases have been remediated information on the cleanup of many of these releases (if applicable) was not available.

Former Use: The subject parcel was originally developed in the early 1880s with a mill building associated with the IWC Mill Complex (formerly referred to as the Sanford Mills).

According to historic resources provided to Ransom, the Site reportedly consisted of undeveloped land until 1866, when construction of the Continental Mill Complex began. Construction of the mill complex, including the Picker House, was completed by 1868. The Site and surrounding mill complex were used for cotton mill operations until the mid-1960's. Between the mid-1960's and circa 2017, the Site and surrounding mill complex supported a variety of commercial operations, including stamp production within the basement and a fitness facility within the northern portion of the Site building, respectively.

Reportedly, open timber crib work was floated to the Site area and sunk to the river bottom by adding material, providing a surface for Site operations since then.  Since at least 1902, the Site was developed with several structures.  By 1914, the Site was primarily used for fertilizer and oil storage.  At least six storage buildings existed named the McLaughlin Store Houses, a filling room, a glue room, a cooper shop, and at least six circular ASTs.  By 1949, the Site was used for storage by several companies, including the McLaughlin Warehouse Company, the W.H. Shurtleff Company (salt), and the Barrett Division Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation. The Site contained a boiler house and two Tarvia tanks surrounded by a 5-foot ditch.  A rail spur entered the Site from the south and traveled up past the boiler house in the northern portion of the Site.  

By 1960, Allied Chemical Corporation took over Site operations which included one remaining shop/warehouse, a boiler room, two loading tanks, two pump sheds, and a 6-foot concrete dike surrounding at least 12 tar ASTs of varying sizes.  From approximately 1979 to 2014, the Site operated as a licensed oil terminal facility.  In 2004, when ownership was transferred to Pike Industries from Barrett Paving, the Oil Terminal Facility License states 21 ASTs with a total storage capacity of approximately 2,301,012 gallons were utilized at the Site.  Between February and May of 2020, S.E. MacMillan Company began decommissioning the Site by disposing of and removing the old buildings and ASTs.  The boiler and pump houses were removed, leaving only the concrete foundations, while the blender and office buildings, and concrete diked area were left in place and used for storage.  An additional concrete foundation of unknown past use exists north of the boiler house foundation.  In July 2021, contaminated soil was excavated and removed from the Site.  In April 2022, the Site was entered into the Maine DEP's Voluntary Response Action Program (VRAP).

The parcels are identified by the Town Assessor's Office as Lots 405-39 and 405-43 on Tax Maps 43 and 44, respectively. The Site is bounded by residential properties and undeveloped, wooded land to the north; a commercial shopping center to the west; and undeveloped, wooded land to the east and south. Lot 405-39 (western portion of the Site) is approximately 9.0 acres, and Lot 405-43 (eastern portion of the Site) is approximately 7.7 acres. Lot 405-39 is developed with a senior housing facility, which consists of three single-story, slab on grade apartment buildings and the adjoining paved parking lot. This portion of the Site is accessible via Hancock Street to the north. The remaining eastern and southern portions of the Site are undeveloped and heavily wooded with the exception of a former railroad corridor that traverses the Site north to south. Additionally, a trailhead located on the western adjoining Gray Plaza parcel crosses the southern corner of the Site and connects to the former railroad corridor. Earliest Site development occurred circa 1910 with the construction of a north-south railroad in the eastern Site extents; this railroad remained in operation until approximately 1933. By 1940, the Site was divided between established farming operations in the western extents and other agricultural activities across the remainder. Around 1970, supporting earthwork and land development related to the Gray Plaza construction took place in the western portion of the Site. Around this time, a mix of undeveloped woodland and cleared terrain encompassed most of the Site. In 1972, an estimated 50 vehicles were also stored within an approximate 1-acre gravel parking lot in the northeastern portion of the Site.
In 1976, the affordable housing complex was constructed in the western portion of the Site, and by 1980, the gravel parking lot was no longer occupied with vehicles. The ensuing decades, especially the 2000s, witnessed the natural reforestation of areas not dedicated to housing, and the Site has sustained these conditions up to the present.

In 2019,  a Phase I ESA was performed for the Site on behalf of Avesta, which revealed no RECs or Vapor Encroachment Conditions (VECs) but noted a potential environmental concern related to the former gravel parking and auto storage/salvage area. A Limited Phase II ESA was then performed in October 2019, which revealed lead and total chromium concentrations in surface soil samples exceeding Maine DEP Remedial Action Guidelines (RAGs) for multiple exposure scenarios. To further assess these exceedances, Ransom executed a Supplemental Phase II ESA in November 2020, which further delineated the extent of lead and potential chromium concentrations. The Phase II ESA identified no other detections of lead or speciated chromium in soil exceeding the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) RAGs.",GRAY

The railroad right of way still exists and is currently in use as a snowmobile trail. The Maine Narrow Gauge Railroad museum, currently located in Portland, is purchasing 1.5 miles of the right of way and and adjoining parcel of land to construct a new museum and reconstruct a section of narrow gauge railway as a historical amusement.

Former Use: The ""Museum Parcel"" of the Site and the surrounding area to the east and south were undeveloped until approximately 1970. The surrounding area to the west and north of the Site was developed as part of Gray’s downtown village since the 1800s. Historical ownership indicates the Site was used as farmland in the 1960s. The earliest development of the Site as farmland is not known from reasonably ascertainable sources. By 1970, the area north of the Site had been cleared and prepped for construction, and by 1973 a portion of the adjoining Gray Plaza had been constructed to the north. By 1991, the adjoining plaza reached its current configuration. The Site and surrounding area have remained relatively unchanged since 1991. The only evidence of Site modification is an apparent drainage related channel, which was constructed in 2009 or 2010. The drainage channel appears to originate from the Gray Plaza parking lot and extends to the south onto the Site. The railroad Right of Way (ROW) portion of the Site is bordered by 27 privately owned parcels and bisects several. The ROW was originally an undeveloped part of the area known as Gray Meadow. W. Scott Libbey and Henry W. Wingley created the Portland, Gray & Lewiston Railroad in 1909 and construction of the ROW, power line, and tracks began in approximately 1910. The Portland, Gray & Lewiston Railroad made its maiden voyage on July 7, 1914, and on July 10 became the Portland-Lewiston Interurban Railway. On October 23, 1914, the Androscoggin Electrical Company was created and acquired the Portland-Lewiston Interurban Railway.",Gray

","This property is a former truck stop and maintenance garage located in a fairly industrial area in the Town of Houlton. This property was recently sold to a local plumbing contractor who hopes to reuse the on site building for equipment and materials storage. The purchase and sale of the property was contingent on the findings of the Phase II ESA. The Phase II ESA concluded that based on the observed site conditions, lack of petroleum-impacted soil and the proposed future use of the facility as commercial, no further action was deemed necessary. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection MDEP has agreed with these conclusions.

Former Use: This property was formerly used as a service garage and truck stop. It was initially reported that there were former underground storage tanks USTs on the subject property. However, during Phase II ESA activities on September 30, 2009, on site personnel received verbal reports that the tanks may have actually been aboveground.

According to the 1980 Sanborn map, the large structure was later occupied by the W.H. Shurtleff Co. chemical warehouse. The types of chemicals formerly stored at the Site are unknown. 

The waterfront area surrounding the Site was historically occupied by various industrial/commercial entities, including a lumber yard, an ice and oil company, grocery warehouses, and storage of goods, including fertilizer. Historical housekeeping practices and environmental regulatory requirements were not at today's standards during the history of operations. Additionally, several documented releases have occurred in the area and soil vapor sampling at the adjacent Lot 12 identified elevated concentrations of chloroform.  The former chemical warehouse at the subject Site (Lot 12A) was considered to be a potential source of the chloroform.

The Portland Waterfront area (from Fore Street to the south) was filled in the mid-1800s. The source of the fill material is unknown. Previous investigations at the adjacent Lot 12 have identified the presence of anthropogenic fill material throughout the Site (including brick and cobble) and elevated concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil, which are often found in fill material. Additionally, railroad tracks were present at the Site from at least 1896 through the 1980s.",PORTLAND

254733,80 Whitney Road,NA,"The Site is an approximate 3-acre backlot, which adjoins an eastern property parcel along Whitney Road.  The Site is heavily wooded with the exception of a large clearing in a central-eastern area where significant solid waste disposal has occurred.  Solid waste primarily comprises tires; however, other wastes are intermingled with the tires, including (but not limited to): rusted/deteriorated 55-gallon drums, household appliances, asphalt shingles, gas cans/tanks, scrap automobile parts, scrap wood, and half buried solid waste and household refuse.  The Site can be accessed via a former gravel path which connects the Site to the eastern adjoining property; however, an access agreement has not been obtained by the Town to enter via this property.  For this reason, the Site was accessed via the Central Maine Power (CMP) corridor to the south of the Site during the completion of this Phase I ESA.

The Site has remained undeveloped throughout documented history; however, the eastern adjoining property, which was used as an access point for waste disposal on Site, had been improved with a residential structure by 1970.  Sometime prior to the 1990s, illegal dumping had occurred on Site; however, the first Site activity is not confirmed until 1991, when aerial photography depicts a clearing in the central-eastern portion of the Site.  

In 1998, a complaint was filed with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), which first identified the illegal operation of a junkyard and solid waste disposal location on both the Site and eastern adjoining property.  Shortly after, the Maine DEP inspected the Site, and estimated it was covered with 2,000 tires.  The inspection also identified approximately ten 55-gallon drums of unknown liquids and 50 lead-acid batteries in various forms of bad storage on the Site and eastern adjoining property; several dead cars, trucks, and boats were also observed.  From 1998 to 2001, the Maine DEP and Town Code Enforcement Office conducted follow-up inspections of the Site; however, minimal clean-up efforts (if any) were made by the former owner.  Ultimately, corrective actions to clean-up the Site were never pursued by the Town or the Maine DEP.  

In addition to allowing illegal dumping on Site, the former owner operated an auto repair and maintenance garage on the eastern adjoining property without proper Site plan approval from the Town.  The garage was constructed in 1998 and was likely used until sometime prior to 2018, when it burned down.  Circa 2014, the Site was divided from a former larger lot, as a developer was seeking to purchase northern adjoining land, while avoiding environmental issues related to the Site.  In 2016, the Town acquired the Site via tax foreclosure.
